- Build / basecode
	- Use asm basecode instead?
	- Handle failed build properly
	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod
	- possibly some more of iq's small-compile tricks need to be reinstated in basecode proj (see http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/compilingsmall/compilingsmall.htm)	
	- when overbyte, tell how many to lose!	
	- Fast/slow build settings could be optimised -- check Schneegestober's, they're good (I think)
	
- General
	- Only free fly mode cam works - HIGH IMPORTANCE
	- Project creation is still quite fragile
	- Trying to load proj from wrong directories etc gives nonsensical message
	- Click to goto line on glsl error
	- "Rebuild 4klang output" button to get new tool tip "Render music"
	- Quite a few buttons missing tooltips
	- Ability to fork would be nice
	- Option to choose git commit message when saving would be nice
	- Inconsistent logscreen output/conventions 
	- Project does not remember if Cam Track was set
	- I can't set Cam Track without Sync Timeline, is this by design? UI needs clarified if so
	- Cam position doesn't need to show in transport any more
	- Inconsistent substitutions
		//#SYNCCODE# vs CAMVARS
	- Cam track needs a button icon alongside sync vars toggle
	!! 4klang mode basecode is a little broken; USE_CLINKSTER should be defined (or not defined) in 4kampfpanzerin.h, not intro.h and/or main_deb.cpp as currently.
	Also there's a missing return from MusicFrame if in 4klang mode.
	- When loading a project, the prod length doesn't get picked up properly by the transport control until you hit Play
