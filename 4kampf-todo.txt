- General
	- Target Location on Import gets a bit recursive :D
	- Would be nice to just be able to paste 4klang .inc and .h and have it build the .obj instead of manually pre-building it
	- Click to goto line on glsl error
		- Actually too tricky -- line nums are reported wrong cos of defines and stuff
	- Ability to fork would be nice
	- Option to choose git commit message when saving would be nice
CHK	- I can't set Cam Track without Sync Timeline, is this by design? UI needs clarified if so
	- Cam track needs a button icon alongside sync vars toggle
!	- 16:9 button
	- Project does not remember if Cam Track was set
	- Possibly also clinkster -- CHECK PROJ OOPTION SAVIN / LOADIN / APPLYIN IN GENERAL
!	- Beat It Clive should CLOSE app if just opened
		- Check raizor's commit
	
- Build / basecode
	- Use pure asm basecode instead?
		- I mean, yeah
	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
		- Fuck it, 1080 is fine these days
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod
	- possibly some more of iq's small-compile tricks need to be reinstated in basecode proj (see http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/compilingsmall/compilingsmall.htm)	
	- Fast/slow build settings could be optimised -- CHECK AGAINST PRODS / SKOMP
	- Toggle whether to do an initial swapbuffers() to clear a screen for precalc (or derive this automagically: if 4klang and no extra sound thread, do it; if clinkster, always do it....
