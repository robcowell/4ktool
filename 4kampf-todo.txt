- Build / basecode
	- Use asm basecode instead?
	- Handle failed build properly
	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod

- General
	- Only free fly mode cam works - HIGH IMPORTANCE
	- Project creation is still quite fragile
	- Trying to load proj from wrong directories etc gives nonsensical message
	- Click to goto line on glsl error
	- Ability to fork would be nice
	- Option to choose git commit message when saving would be nice
	- Inconsistent logscreen output/conventions 
	- Project does not remember if Cam Track was set
	- I can't set Cam Track without Sync Timeline, is this by design? UI needs clarified if so
	- Cam track needs a button icon alongside sync vars toggle
	- When loading a project, the prod length doesn't get picked up properly by the transport control until you hit Play. This means if you just start the tool, open a proj and try to Build it, you'll get PROD_LENGTH 0 in the header file dogg
	- Use Wait cursors for bitbucket ops
