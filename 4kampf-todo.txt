!! = Really important dogg
! = Also pretty important yo

- General
!!	- When loading a project, the prod length doesn't get picked up properly by the transport control until you hit Play. This means if you just start the tool, open a proj and try to Build it, you'll get PROD_LENGTH 0 in the header file dogg
!!	- Only free fly mode cam works, pls to fix the other 2 :)
!	- Would be nice to just be able to paste 4klang .inc and .h and have it build the .obj instead of manually pre-building it
!	- Unpacked Release is broken (or maybe just doesn't toggle Clinkster/4klang correctly)
	- Project creation is still quite fragile
	- Trying to load proj from wrong directories etc gives nonsensical message
!	- Click to goto line on glsl error
	- Ability to fork would be nice
	- Option to choose git commit message when saving would be nice
!	- I can't set Cam Track without Sync Timeline, is this by design? UI needs clarified if so
	- Cam track needs a button icon alongside sync vars toggle

- Build / basecode
	- Use asm basecode instead?
	- Handle failed build properly
	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod
	- Toggle whether to do an initial swapbuffers() to clear a screen for precalc (or derive this automagically: if 4klang and no extra sound thread, do it; if clinkster, always do it....
	
Cleared these:
[FIXED]- Project does not remember if Cam Track was set
[FIXED]- Project does not remember if Use 4klang env was set
[FIXED]- Add try/catch around git/bitbucket blocks
[FIXED]- Add better logging around git/bitbucket
[FIXED]- Inconsistent logscreen output/conventions 
[FIXED]- Use Wait cursors for bitbucket ops
