- Build / basecode
	- Use asm basecode instead?
	- Handle failed build properly
	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod
	- possibly some more of iq's small-compile tricks need to be reinstated in basecode proj (see http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/compilingsmall/compilingsmall.htm)	
	- when overbyte, tell how many to lose!	
	- Fast/slow build settings could be optimised -- check Schneegestober's, they're good
