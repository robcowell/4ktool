- THE BIG QUESTIONS
	- Was Clinkster a dead end we can now drop?

- General
	- Target Location on Import gets a bit recursive :D
	- Would be nice to just be able to paste 4klang .inc and .h and have it build the .obj instead of manually pre-building it
	- Click to goto line on glsl error
		- Actually too tricky -- line nums are reported wrong cos of defines and stuff
WIP[Skomp]- Ability to fork would be nice
CHK	- I can't set Cam Track without Sync Timeline, is this by design? UI needs clarified if so
	- Cam track needs a button icon alongside sync vars toggle

- Project.kml
!	- Render toggle to be proj setting (helpful for exe gfx prods)
	- Project does not remember if Cam Track was set
	- Possibly also clinkster -- CHECK PROJ OOPTION SAVIN / LOADIN / APPLYIN IN GENERAL
	- Vertex shader toggle
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod	
	- Derive whether to do an initial swapbuffers() to clear a screen for precalc: if 4klang and no extra sound thread, do it; if clinkster, always do it....
	
- Build / basecode
CHK	- Possibly some more of iq's small-compile tricks need to be reinstated in basecode proj (see http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/compilingsmall/compilingsmall.htm)	
	- Use pure asm basecode instead?
		- I mean, yeah
WF	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
WF		- Fuck it, 1080 is fine these days :D
	- Fast/slow build settings could be optimised -- CHECK AGAINST PRODS / SKOMP
		- Less of both those things on Fast, but add Instant
		
- New project options:
