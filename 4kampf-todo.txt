!! = Really important dogg
! = Also pretty important yo

- General
!!	- Only free fly mode cam works, pls to fix the other 2 :)
!	- Would be nice to just be able to paste 4klang .inc and .h and have it build the .obj instead of manually pre-building it
	- Project creation is still quite fragile
	- Trying to load proj from wrong directories etc gives nonsensical message
!	- Click to goto line on glsl error
	- Ability to fork would be nice
	- Option to choose git commit message when saving would be nice
!	- I can't set Cam Track without Sync Timeline, is this by design? UI needs clarified if so
	- Cam track needs a button icon alongside sync vars toggle

- Build / basecode
	- Use asm basecode instead?
	- Handle failed build properly
	- Choose resolution to build?? Batch build resolutions?? Something else?
	- Toggle whether to do a proper mode change -- saves 10 bytes in final prod
	- Toggle whether to do an initial swapbuffers() to clear a screen for precalc (or derive this automagically: if 4klang and no extra sound thread, do it; if clinkster, always do it....
