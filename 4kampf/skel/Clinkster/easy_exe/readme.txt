This setup is for easily building an executable version of a piece of music
created using Clinkster.

Proceed as follows:

1. Place your music here, named music.xrns.
2. Place a text file containing the text you would like the executable to
   print at startup, named music.txt.
3. Optionally modify the Crinkler options in crinkler_options.txt
   (read the Crinkler manual for details).
4. Run build.bat to get an executable that plays the music, or
   build_wav.bat to get one that writes the music in WAV format to
   music.wav and then plays it.

Enjoy!
