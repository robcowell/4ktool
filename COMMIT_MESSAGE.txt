Add Sointu WebAssembly integration for client-side music synthesis

This commit implements client-side music rendering using Sointu compiled
to WebAssembly, enabling real-time audio synthesis in the browser without
requiring server-side rendering.

Key features:
- Web Worker implementation to prevent UI blocking during song compilation
- Visual progress bar with real-time updates during rendering (0-100%)
- Efficient audio buffer transfer from worker to main thread using Transferable objects
- Pre-rendered audio playback with interleaved stereo Float32Array format
- Test page (test-wasm.html) for validating WASM functionality

Technical changes:
- Modified Sointu Go code (sointu/cmd/sointu-wasm/main.go) to export functions
  instead of running as CLI, including compileSong, renderSamples, getEnvelopeSync
- Added helper functions (audioBufferToJSArray, envelopeDataToJSArray) to convert
  Go audio buffers to JavaScript-compatible arrays
- Created sointu-wasm-worker.js to run WASM compilation in background thread
- Updated sointu-wasm-interop.js to handle worker communication and audio playback
- Fixed progress bar CSS (removed max-width constraint) and added regression prevention
- Implemented console.log interception to forward progress messages from worker

The implementation uses Go's WebAssembly target with syscall/js for JavaScript
interop, allowing the existing Sointu synthesis engine to run entirely in the
browser. Audio is pre-rendered during compilation and streamed via WebAudio API
for smooth playback.

Build requirements:
- Go 1.21+ installed
- Sointu repository cloned in project root
- Run build-sointu-wasm.sh to compile WASM module

Tested with physics_girl_st.yml example song (79.38s, 6 instruments).
